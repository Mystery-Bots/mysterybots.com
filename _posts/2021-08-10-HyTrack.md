A few days ago we release HyTrack, a all in one Hypixel Stats and SkyBlock bot. While the bot is currently only in version 0.1.2 it's constantly being worked on with new updates to include stats from more gamemodes and also the release of SkyBlock commands. 

0.1.2 of the bot contains the following features

- linking accounts
- Network player counts
- Network status and updates
- Bed Wars and SkyWars stats
- Player stats
- Skin and name histories
- And more

I hope you enjoy using HyTrack and continue to follow the development of the bot over the coming weeks as more gamemodes get released. Also make sure to join the Discord to say up to date with all the news and information
