A while ago we manage to hit 1k members in the Among Us Bot support server. This is so amazing as I never expected it to really happen. Personally I want to thank the Support and Staff team that have helped in managing and supporting the community when I was either busy or away. 

I also would like to thank you all for inviting the bot to over 26 thousand servers. While your constant support is appreciated, thank you especially to those who have brought **premium** which has helped with keeping the bot going and allowing me to expand to new systems. 

While Among Us Bots updates won't come out as often. It doesn't mean I have stopped working on bots all together. Over the past month I have been planning away for the creation of a new more advance Discord bot that I plan to release sometime next year. Over the coming months you might see small glimpses of what is to come but likely not much will show up till a working release is complete. 

I wish you all an amazing Christmas and a happy New Year and look forward to everything that is to come. <br>
Thank you all<br>
