Welcome to Mystery Bots Studios. The home of news and information about each of our projects. As well as displaying out projects you can check out the [blog](/blog/) for updates from us about events that are happening.

## Among Us Bot

Among Us Bot was the first bot released by Mystery Bots Studios and within 1 month grew to over 8 thousand Discord servers which was crazy and meant we had to rewrite the whole bot to a new API. Also In 13 days we got the bot verified which has allowed us to create a recognizable brand around the bot and provided people with a bot they can trust.
As of 04/18/2021 Among Us Bot has been shutdown. Thank you for the constant support with the project ❤️

## TL Events

TL Events or TheLoungeMC Events was a bot created for TheLoungeMCs Discord server for a Christmas Event. It involves randomly spawning a gift every 10-30 minutes. These gifts had different rarities which would reward users with a different amount of points. There were also some custom joke command that could be discovered by users which would either respond with a message or change the bots pfp for an hour (Called Cursed Hour). The bots code can be publicly found on our GitHub page or visited through the button below.
